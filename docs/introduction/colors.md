### Colors

Grater Vue is supported by an extensive color system that themes our styles and components. This enables more comprehensive customization and extension for any project.

## Palette

The supported colors can be accessed by the following helpers: `{color-name}` for the background, `color-{color-name}` for the font color and `border-{color-name}` for the border. Each color have its own shade variation degree going from `100` to `900` excluding `500` such as `{color-name}-{degree}`.
